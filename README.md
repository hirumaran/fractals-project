# Julia Set Fractal Generator

An interactive web-based fractal generator that creates beautiful Julia set fractals with customizable parameters and real-time color cycling effects.

## Features

- Interactive Julia set fractal generation
- Real-time color cycling with adjustable speed
- Customizable maximum iterations for detail control
- Responsive design with a modern, dark theme
- Smooth animations and transitions
- User-friendly controls for fractal manipulation

## About the Project

This project was created as a learning experience in combining mathematics and art through fractal generation. It demonstrates the beauty of Julia sets, a type of fractal that creates intricate and mesmerizing patterns through complex number iterations.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use the controls to interact with the fractal:
   - Click "Generate New Fractal" to create a new random Julia set
   - Toggle "Color Cycle" to enable/disable color animation
   - Adjust "Max Iterations" to control the level of detail
   - Modify "Color Speed" to change the animation speed

## Technical Details

The project is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for fractal generation and animations
- CSS3 for styling and animations

The fractal generation uses the Julia set formula:
```
z(n+1) = z(n)Â² + c
```
where c is a complex number that determines the shape of the fractal.
